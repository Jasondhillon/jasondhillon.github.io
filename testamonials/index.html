			<br><br>
			Thanks again for a very enjoyable morning on the water-great break for me from the Disney/Universal madness. I felt like I was fishing with a very knowledgeable buddy instead of a hired guide. It was great how you knew there was a big fish in the area before we even saw it. That's what time on the water gets you
			<br><br>
			Again - great job Tom - hope we can hook up again.

			That was the best day of fly fishing for reds I have ever had. I was happy with the first big red on fly but then we topped it with an even bigger redfish. You showed great patience until we found the right fly and it was truly the fishing trip of a life time! I do not expect to top that fishing trip but I look forward to trying next year in 2011.

You took the time to teach us and made our trip extremely enjoyable. I was really excited that you took the extra effort to help us locate the fish and put us on them. We had a blast and will use your services over and over again when we visit our Florida office. Thanks again for the great experience and the chance to have you as a friend!

			<td class="td2"><p>Dear Cap'n Carver,
			<br><br>
			Way back in October of 2010 you treated my new bride, Minda, and I to a awesome day of fishing. Our  catch was  a Redfish each  you helped introduce her to fishing in a very exciting and humane manner. I know you've had many guests since our trip but perhaps the attached pics will jog your memory. We'd like to come back and try again, this time adding a friend. As was the case with Minda this will be an introductory flats fishing trip for him. He is a good guy and will be a pleasure to take on board.At this point I'm hoping to get an idea of how the action might be in mid-January. Our friend is fairly flexible as to date and, like us, he is located here in FL.  I'm also curious how long your $119.00 per person special runs. It is a great deal and I'd like to take advantage of it. Given that it has a limited life I assume I could book a trip for three now and then set the actual date sometime in the future.

They say it's like fishing with an old friend. We here Murrays bait and tackle look forward to helping you in any way to make your customer satisfied. Now stop reading this email and go fishing.
