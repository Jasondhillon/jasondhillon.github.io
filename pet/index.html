<h1 style="margin: 10px">Tigger</h1>
<p>My favorite pet is my cat. His name is Tigger. My cat doesn't know any special tricks, other than eating and sleeping. I prefer Tigger, over my other cat, Sophie, because this is my cat, and Sophie is my brother's cat. I received Tigger as a Birthday present when I turning 14. He is a rescue cat that we picked up from Pet's Mart. We've had him for almost 7 years now. He doesn't like to be man-handled too much and much prefers to do things at his own pace.
