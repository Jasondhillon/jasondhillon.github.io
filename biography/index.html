<h1 style="margin: 10px">Who am I?</h1>
<p style="margin: 10px; text-indent: 20px; width: 500px">My name is Jason Dhillon. I grew up in Orlando, Florida. I first went to college at Florida State for a year, then transferred to Valencia. I am majoring in Computer Science and already have experience in Java. I've made a few basic apps for Android and took a programming course in high school. I'm looking to expand my programming knowledge by learning C and HTML/CSS, and hope that in the future I'll learn JavaScript and C++. Valencia is a great school as it's much cheaper than a state college and the classes are much smaller, allowing the professors to enagage more with the students.

<h1 style="margin: 10px">Goals for the Future</h1>
<p style="margin: 10px; text-indent: 20px; width: 500px"> My plans are to become a mobile app developer. I really like how android is setup, as it is a mixture of XML and Java, however I'm not opposed to learning Swift, which is the language required to program iPhone apps. I first got inspired to develop apps when flappy bird arrived on the app store. From what I've read, the developer made huge profits from advertisements despite the app being free. If such a simple app like flappy bird can make bank, then there is no telling what the next huge app will be, and who knows, it might just be mine.
